# Keyboard layouts reviews and notes

(not sure exactly where this is going.. so may layouts out there..)



## Angle mod
source: https://github.com/Apsu/APT
On traditional row-stagger keyboards, the bottom row keys on the left side can be difficult to press with the same fingers used for the home/top row in the same columns. One workaround popularized for the Colemak layouts is known as an Angle Mod.

This mod rotates the first 5 letters in the bottom row left by 1 spot, and the leftmost letter is wrapped around to the 5th spot (QWERTY b spot). In conjunction with the letter shifts, the intention is that you will also change the fingers you use, so the SFB/column relationships are maintained.



## Dvorak

```
    '   ,   .   p   y      f   g   c   r   l   /
    a   o   e   u   i      d   h   t   n   s   -
    ;   q   j   k   x      b   m   w   v   z   `
```

Next to QWERTY it is the most well known layout.

```
w l y p k   z x o u ; [ ] \
 c r s t b   f n e i a '
  j v d g q   m h / , .
```

ortha

```
    w   l   y   p       b   z   f   o   u   '
    c   r   s   t       g   m   n   e   i   a
    q   j   v   d       k   x   h   /   ,   . 
```

## Engram 
Source: https://engram.dev/

```
    B   Y   O   U   '    L   D   W   V   Z
    C   I   E   A   ,    H   T   S   N   Q
    G   X   J   K   -    R   M   F   P
```

Engram is fairly similar to Dvorak making the transition from one to the other fairly easy. Here we analyze where letters are found on the same row.

```
   Y                     L
   A   E   I             H   T   N   S
   J   K   X             M
```



## APTv3

    w g d f b q l u o y
     r s t h k j n e a i ;
       c m p v x z , . ' /

and without the angle mod

    w  g  d  f  b   q  l  u  o  y
    r  s  t  h  k   j  n  e  a  i  ;
    x  c  m  p  v   z  ,  .  '  /
