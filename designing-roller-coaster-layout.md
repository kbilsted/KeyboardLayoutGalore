	woump  'yldfz
	sinab  'ethrj
	xck;,  /q.gv-


Too much trampolining with R on pinky.. we put R it there to reduce pinky but broke ER (2.05%)
support TH + HE + ER  and same row for AL (1.09) + LE (0.83) + LI (0.62)
(swap R<->L)

Less trambolining with TH-E (EHT -> THE)
	woump  'yrdfz

more bigram by moving r to pinky again
(swap R<->L)

Move OU to stronger hand (7.6%+2.73%)

Improve SFB for ND (1.35% ) + MA (0.57%)
(SWAP D<->Mb
	wlmdp  'youfz
	sinab  'therj
	xvk;,  /q.gc-


more rolling but with more finger movements
then we swap B-P since P is more frequent 
(SWAP D<->B<->P)
	wlmpb  'youfz
	sinad  'therj
	xvk;,  /q.gc-


remove lateral stress 
move D<->K
	wlmpb  'youfz

make more like HD
(L<->F)

optimize ND (1.56%) and place D on a stronger finger
(D<->Q)
	wfmpb  'youlz
	sinak  'therj

optimize and place V (1.05%) on a stronger finger Q (0.12)
(D<->Q)
	wfmpb  'youlz
	sinak  'therj
	xqv;,  /d.gc-



more rolls with g on homerow - but yields more SFB
('<->G)
	wfmpb  'youlz
	sinak  gtherj
	xqv;,  /d.*c-
	
	

more rolls with V on top (5 more bigrams but 0.1% SFB)
(V<->B) .. but i remember not liking V up here.. lets try for a bit..
	wfmpv  'youlz
	sinak  gtherj
	xqb;,  /d.*c-
	

Can we reverse the "THER" to "REHT" and get a better result? 
T is 9,28% and R is 6.28% so we would increase pinky by 3%!


(G<->K) move work to other finger - works really nice with G on index) possibly due to trigram "ING"
(J<->W) 
(reverse Y-O-U - nicer place for O and gives inward roll on "found", "you" etc rather than outward rolls
using our optimizer we accidently placed F on top row

	jcmpb  'luofz
	sinag  ytherw
	xqd.-  ,kv./*
	
OR and RO isnt that bad.. words like "and", hand is so nice would
"found" is pretty cool "roof".. also 
AGAIn is uncomfortable



more movement for index--but many more bigrams.. lets evaluate

	jcmpb  'luofz
	sinad  gtherw
	xqy.,  -kv./*";

!!! Didn't like it ! Too much index Going back!


old layout again

	jcmpb  'luofz
	sinag  ytherw
	xqd.-  ,kv./*


support 3rd most trigram "AND" (1.2%) for 3 fingers rather than 2 fingers
.. and place C as qwerty
and improve SFB
and make other words easier eg "AD" (0.5%) 
(C<->D)
	jdmpb  'luofz
	sinag  ytherw
	xqc.-  ,kv./*


support 5th trigram "FOR" (0.6%) better 
and DIRECT 7th trigram "YOU" (0.6%) 
"ly","by" also much easier to type
and improve SFB
(F<->Y)

	jdmpb  'luoyz
	sinag  ftherw
	xqc.-  ,kv./*


miniscule improvement and make it look more like qwerty
(X<->Z)

	jdmpb  'luoyx
	sinag  ftherw
	zqc.-  ,kv./*



slightly worse.. but want to move C to top due to it being more frequent
hurts "AC" (1%), 
improves "OC" (0.8%), "CU" (0.3%), "NC (0.3%) easier
move "V" since the spot is much easier to reach on a stagered keyboard

(C<->P)
(V<->.) costs 1% SFB! but so easier to hit
	jdmcb  'luoyx
	sinag  ftherw
	zqp,-  .k.v/*


(Z<->X) feels more natural 
	jdmcb  'luoyz
	sinag  ftherw
	xqp,-  .k.v/*


improve rolls by 0.6%
(P<->K)
Tempting to swap Y-W but it yields more sfb, breaks the trigram and reduces bigrams

	jdmcb  'luoyz
	sinag  ftherw
	xqk,-  .p.v/*

wonderfull change! much better rolls!
eg "thanks", "pasted" "stops", "key" 



maybe swap F-G -- slightly better SFB but 1% less rolls in each direction!!
















--> old 

Going through an analyser we can increase right hand usage from 41% to 46%

(D<->F  to move work to other finger - works really nice-- words like "would", "should")
