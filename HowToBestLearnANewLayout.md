# How to best learn a new layout 


General advice
* Practice using a type mentor. 
* Start with homerow characters and words
* Write the layout down on paper or in an editor to use the layout. 
* Memorize parts of the layout - max 5 characters at a time 
* Memorize by typing words or shortcuts you use a lot such as `Ctrl T`, `Ctrl C`, `Ctrl V` 
* Practice often - 5-10 mins every day
* Consider changing the keyboard on your phone (nice idea but perhaps you don't get to like it)

## Free tutors using graphical hands

* https://www.typing.com/ - traditional exercises starting with `F-J` then `R-U`. Lots of badgets, motivational stars, XP, small information videos, etc to keep you motivated. Already at lesson 2 keys  outside the homerow is included.
* https://www.keybr.com/  - using AI to adapt to the users performance. Sounds great, but my experience has been the AI keeps droning on the homerow letters forever and ever.

## Typing for "pro's"

* https://monkeytype.com/ is really the place to be. While the interface at first is deceptively crude, know that it can do *everything*.

Tips for monkeytype
