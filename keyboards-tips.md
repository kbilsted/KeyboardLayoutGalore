I recently dug up my old kinesis Ergo Elan. It made a lot of sounds when typing. Here are some tips for reducing keyboard sounds:

**How do you turn off the "beep" & "click" sounds of the keyboard?**
The keyboard has two different audio sounds produced from the keyboard. A soft "click" noise when pressing any key and a louder "beep" noise when pressing Caps Lock, Scroll Lock, Num Lock or Keypad.
* To disable the "click" noise, press and hold the Progrm key and tap the piples/backslash key (the key directly to the right of the letter `P`).
* To disable the "beep" noise, press and hold the Progrm key and tap the hyphen/underscore key (the key directly below `Progrm`).


**How do I reset a remapped key to its factory setting?**
You can reset a key to its factory setting by "remapping it to itself." Entering remapping mode and press the key twice, then exit from remapping mode.
